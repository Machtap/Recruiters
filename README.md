Simple Rules for Recruiting me
<ol>
<li>All introductions and role presentations must begin through email or LinkedIn.  If you try to call me I will immediately direct you to use one of my preferred communication methods.</li>
<li>I require details up front, if you don’t provide remote status, tech stack and compensation range in your initial message, I will immediately request these three items via an auto-responder.</li>
<li>If you have multiple roles but aren’t sure which would be most interesting to me, include the three required details for each role in a list for me to review.  If you are unsure what this list might look like, here is an excellent example: https://i.imgur.com/Uh0SvAe.png</li>
<li>Please do not attempt to contact or solicit my information from any of my family members, past / present romantic partners or current / former employers.</li>
<li>Comp ranges are expressed in numerical terms. “Market rate”, “competitive” or similar language is not acceptable.</li>
<li>Comp ranges should be constrained to 20% of the total value. Saying “$45-$145/hr” or “$85k/yr-$300k/yr” is not acceptable.</li>
<li>While I'm always happy to submit a resume or sit an interview for an agreed role, due to the volume of requests I'm not able to engage in pre-interview personality assesments, coding excersizes or online questionnaires. If these items are part of an application or hiring process they should come after an initial meeting with a human at the hiring company</li>
<li>You are contacting me, unsolicited. I am not obligated to reply to you.</li>
<li>If you have read all of these items completely and your message complies with them, please include the term ‘polymorphism’ in all caps in your subject line, this will drastically improve the chances of receiving a reply, or an introductory phone call.</li>
</ol>

Thank you and good luck!
