Simple Rules for Recruiting me
<ol>
<li>All introductions and role presentations must begin through email or LinkedIn.  If you try to start with a call I will immediately direct you to use one of my preferred communication methods.</li>
<li>I require details up front, if you don’t provide remote status, tech stack and compensation range in your initial message, I will immediately request these three items via an auto-responder.</li>
<li>If you have multiple roles but aren’t sure which would be most interesting to me, include the three required details for each role in a list for me to review.  If you are unsure what this list might look like, here is an excellent example from one of your competitors: https://i.imgur.com/Uh0SvAe.png</li>
<li>Please do not attempt to contact or solicit my information from any of my family members, past / present romantic partners or current / former employers.</li>
<li>Comp ranges are expressed in numerical terms. “Market rate”, “competitive”, "depending on experience" or similar language is not acceptable.</li>
<li>Comp ranges should be constrained to 20% of the total value. Saying “$45-$145/hr” or “$85k/yr-$300k/yr” is not acceptable.</li>
<li>While I'm always happy to submit a resume or sit an interview for an agreed role, due to the volume of requests I'm not able to engage in pre-interview personality assesments, coding exercises or online questionnaires. If these items are part of an application or hiring process they should come after an initial meeting with a human at the hiring company</li>
<li>I'm not able to provide references directly to technical recruiters, if references are required I can provide them directly to the hiring manager at an appropriate point in the interview process</li>
<li>Extreme preference is given to recruiters that embrace a low touch sales approach, be mindful that only hiring managers can convince me to take a job, while recruiters only stand to talk themselves out of a placement. Be deliberate and considerate before you press the send or call button</li>
<li>You are contacting me, unsolicited. I am not obligated to reply to you.  If the extent of your recruitment services involve directing me to a public job application page and following up with a lecture about not accepting counter-offers then you don't deserve a fee for placing me. </li>
<li>If you have read all of these items completely and your message complies with them, please include the term ‘polymorphism’ in all caps in your subject line, this will drastically improve the chances of receiving a reply, or an introductory phone call.</li>
</ol>

Thank you and good luck!
