Simple Rules for Recruiting me
<ol>
<li>1. All introductions and role presentations must begin through email or LinkedIn.  If you try to call me I will immediately direct you to use one of my preferred communication methods.</li>
<li>2. I require details up front, if you don’t provide the compensation range of the position, the remote status and the tech stack in your initial message, I will immediately request these three items via an auto-responder.</li>
<li>3. Compensation ranges are expressed in numerical terms. “Market rate”, “competitive” or similar language is not acceptable.</li>
<li>4. Comp ranges should be constrained to 20% of the top amount. Saying “$45-$145/hr” or “$85k/yr-$300k/yr” is not acceptable.</li>
<li>5. You are contacting me, unsolicited. I am not obligated to reply to you.  Under no circumstances will I tell you how much I currently make nor will I indicate a desired comp range to you during our initial conversations.</li>
<li>6. If you have multiple roles but aren’t sure which would be most interesting to me, include the three required details for each role in a list for me to review.  If you are unsure what this list might look like, here is an excellent example: https://i.imgur.com/Uh0SvAe.png</li>
<li>7. Please do not attempt to contact or solicit my information from any of my family members, past / present romantic partners or current / former employers.</li>
<li>8. If you have read all of these items completely and your message complies with all of these rules, please include the term ‘polymorphism’ in all caps in your subject line, this will drastically improve the chances of receiving a reply, or an introductory phone call.</li>
